This is a calculator build for The Odin Project by Dareos Meyer.
The purpose of this project was to tie all the different elements of HTML, CSS and JS that have been covered so far in the course. Everything from styling to math functions were left up to me.

This calculator can perform simple arithmetic operations including adding, subtracting, multiplying and dividing. It can both take and return integers and decimal numbers. It can parse multiple operations in a single input or one at a time. It employs both a delete and clear key which toggles depending on context. The plus/minus button works the same way. Each operator replaces the previous one when clicked in a row. This calculator does support keyboard for the number and equals keys.

Things learned in this project:
    * More CSS Grid formatting and other CSS styling techniques.
    * RPN shunting algorithms and parsing functions.
    * Some prototype methods.
    * More event listener use cases.
    * Keyboard integration.
    * More DOM manipulation.
    * The importance of bug testing.
